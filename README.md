# HackYah 2023 - Primal Instincts

Unity version: 2022.3.10f1

## Introduction
As we know from history, dinosaurs were wiped off from Earth by a massive asteroid hitting the planet... Not only killed by the impact but also by the new extreme enviroment created with the event...

But what if dinasours possesed bigger intelligence to survive and coorperate with each other. What if they had overcome every challange caused by the asteroid impact, everyday looking for new ideas to go another day further. Creating new generations of dinosaurs that are more and more capable of surviving extreme challanges given by their world. 

One day they would eventually start exploring new world after hiding and adapting for so long. Maybe they would find the asteroid itself... There was something very suspicious about it.

Of course it can not be that easy! The new enemy stands on their way, but this time it is not a natural disaster, extreme weather or hunger....

Their new enemy are humans. Weaker, uglier and of course less intelligent dinosaurs thought. How could they survive all of these years after the asteroid impact? Or maybe they evolved years after the event... One is for sure. Dinosaurs will not let that slip, they will fight for dominance as they think the world is for them to conquer.
